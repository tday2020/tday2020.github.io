## Step 1 - Setup
 - `os install function-guru`
 - open up `index.html` in your c9 and serve it.
 - open up `function-guru.js` in your c9 and have a look.

## Step 2 - Review Questions from Module One Handbook?
 - what can we `typeof` ?
 - what can't we `typeof` ?
 - how do we check those things?
 - Array.isArray()
 - null === null

## Step 3 - Review Standard Library Methods You Should Know By Now:
 - Object.keys()
 - String.toUpperCase()
 - String.split()
 - Array.join()

## Step 4 - Be The Function Master
For this part of the lesson, you will be working in `function-guru.js`. 

 - If you don't understand what a function is supposed to do, look at the test in `spec/index.spec.js`. If you still don't understand, ask your teacher.

## Step 5 - Submit your masterful functions
 - Once you have completed all functions go to your terminal and run the command `os test`
 - Select your class, then select `Function Guru`
 - You should see 100% passing tests!
   - If you are still failing tests, update your code to pass them
 - Then run `os submit`
 - Select your class, then select `Function Guru`# function-guru
